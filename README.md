# Pong Game

![Pong Game Screenshot](pong-game-screenshot.png)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using 8086 Assembly For my Microprocessor class project. The game involves two paddles and a ball, and the goal is to bounce the ball off the paddles and prevent it from going past your paddle. The game is played in a two-player mode, where each player controls a paddle using w and s for P1 and O and L for P2
